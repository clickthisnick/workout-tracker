Remove empty [] from peoples workouts so we aren't saving extra data
^ after show the # of times person completed workout
^ make average length of workout dependent on # of people
^ its annoying if I forget to enter in a workout before working out again I have to combine the workouts - maybe a script or better format
^ show last time each person did the workout, not just one person
^ show amount of people who have done the workout
